You find yourself in the Starport. As your eyes adjust to the shimmering lights and 
bustling crowd, you feel the cold [alleyway] behind you, some sort of decorated 
[ship] bobbing peacefully in the harbor, an imposing [bank] which seems to be 
glaring at you menacingly, and dubious [merchant] with an extravagant stall,
nonetheless. 

The seaport's buildings offer cheerful contrast to the apocolypse 
in the sky aboveâ€“the [lamppost], decorated with fluttering flags, stands sentinel 
against the ocean, and on a windowsill you notice a cute [plant] directly across 
from an ornamental [fountain]. While being suprisingly clean and orderly, on the 
ground you notice a strange spool of [tape].

Where to go? What to do?
