After slinking for a while in the shadows, you make it to the ship. Its 
draconian head rises above the ocean of stars, and its long, limber sails
rest like elegant wings. These Dragonships travel between the galaxies, 
transporting passengers to worlds beyond the realm of imagination... the 
perfect escape––rumor is, they're actually alive. With one last look at 
the [starport], you scramble up the rope ladder into the ship's hold.

Inside you find a tattered scroll among other maritime instruments. Maybe 
you should [read] it?
